# Transaction Data Analysis

This is a data analysis template of monthly transaction records of high net worth clients of a famous Chinese futures company. 

It covers the customer's break-even analysis, risk preference analysis, trading variety analysis, etc. and visualized the main data. 

As client data needs to be kept confidential, in the project I uploaded a report template in pdf format.
